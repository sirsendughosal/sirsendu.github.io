I am a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at IIT Guwahati under Prof. P. K. Giri, nearing thesis submission. My research spans Experimental Condensed Matter Physics, focusing on SERS/TERS, CVD-grown nanomaterials, and nanostructures for metamaterials, photodetectors, solar desalination, and neuromorphic devices, supported by DFT/FEM simulations.
